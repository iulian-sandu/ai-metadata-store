# AWS Lambda Hackathon - Configuration Store Engine

## Overview

**Problem statement**: As a DevOps engineer in a Cloud Platform team, managing configurations for various tools and pipelines can be challenging. These configurations are critical for providing customers access to AWS accounts and services such as Kubernetes (k8s) or GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

The challenges include:
- Avoiding configuration drift and duplication
- Ensuring a centralized and scalable approach to configuration management
- Maintaining consistency across multiple environments

**Solution**: A Configuration Store Engine with AI capabilities, to provide a centralized, automated and intelligent solution for managing and interact with the configurations.

## Features and functionality

1. Authorization and Authentication - Uses **AWS Cognito** for secure access with client credentials, using machine to machine app client.
2. API Gateway - Provides two resource (```/config``` and ```/ai-chat```)
